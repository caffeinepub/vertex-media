# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update Vertex Media’s site to reflect an active presence on TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook in the footer and Contact page, without changing other site content.

**Planned changes:**
- Replace the existing footer “Connect” social icons/links with TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook, including appropriate aria-labels and opening links in a new tab with `rel="noopener noreferrer"`.
- Optionally add a short, natural-sounding text line in the footer indicating Vertex Media is active on TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook, matching the site’s professional tone.
- Update the Contact page “Connect With Us” icon row to use TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook icons/links, keeping all other Contact page content and layout intact.

**User-visible outcome:** Visitors see TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook social links in the footer and on the Contact page, with consistent styling and unchanged layout across mobile and desktop.
