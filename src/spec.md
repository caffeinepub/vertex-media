# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Remove the “Our Work” / portfolio-gallery (PortfolioPreview) section from the Home page without affecting any other sections or overall page flow.

**Planned changes:**
- Update only the selected elements that comprise the PortfolioPreview section (section header, subtext, and portfolio grid/cards) so the section no longer renders.
- Ensure no leftover empty container, spacing, or visual gaps remain where the portfolio section used to be.

**User-visible outcome:** The Home page no longer shows the “Our Work” heading or portfolio/gallery grid, and the page transitions naturally between the remaining sections with consistent spacing and unchanged header/footer.
