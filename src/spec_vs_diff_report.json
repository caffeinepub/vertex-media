REQ-17 cannot be fully verified from the provided truncated ContactPage diff; only the new icon imports are visible, not the actual “Connect With Us” icon row/links.",

      "reason": "The ContactPage.tsx diff is truncated before showing the “Connect With Us” section. The summary shows only the import of SiInstagram/SiTiktok/SiFacebook, but does not provide evidence that the icon row links were actually replaced/updated (or that no other contact content was changed beyond the social icons/links).",
