  "summary": "Most frontend requirements (design system styling, routing/layout, pages with required sections/forms, CTAs/tagline, portfolio preview, header/footer with social placeholders) appear implemented. Backend submission persistence/methods are present but the Motoko storage/mutation logic shown is likely incorrect (immutable List usage), and there are extra backend/query utilities not requested.",

      "id": "REQ-8",
      "requirement": "Implement backend persistence for Contact inquiries and Join Network applications in the Motoko canister with timestamps; expose canister methods for creating submissions used by the frontend.",
      "reason": "Although submitContact/submitNetworkApplication and timestamp fields are defined, the shown persistence mechanism appears non-functional: submissions are stored in `let` bindings initialized with `List.empty`, then mutated via `contactSubmissions.add(...)` / `networkApplications.add(...)`, which is not shown as valid/working state mutation. This likely prevents actual storage/persistence and could break frontend submissions.",

      "reason": "BuildRequest only asked for methods to create/store submissions for the frontend; admin/review functionality is explicitly a non-goal, and these query endpoints go beyond the requested scope.",
