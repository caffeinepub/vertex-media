  "summary": "PortfolioPreview was changed to render nothing (returns null), and HomePage appears to have removed/cleaned up the portfolio preview usage. This likely removes the “Our Work” section, but the diff shows HomePage was modified, so the constraint/AC that implementation be limited only to the selected PortfolioPreview elements cannot be confirmed and may be violated.",

      "requirement": "Implementation is limited to updating the PortfolioPreview section’s selected elements only (corresponding to the provided XPaths), without modifying other page sections.",
      "reason": "The diff shows changes in both the PortfolioPreview component and the HomePage file. While removing the section may require removing its invocation/import, this goes beyond changes strictly within the PortfolioPreview selected elements/XPaths, and the provided diff does not demonstrate that edits were confined only to the user-selected PortfolioPreview elements.",
